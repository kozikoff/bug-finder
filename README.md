# Bug Finder — Exploratory Testing extension for Chrome

[Bug Finder](https://github.com/kozikoff/bug-finder) makes exploratory testing easier by providing quick access to common problematic values and edge cases right from the context menu (right-click) on editable elements. Keep these useful test inputs handy and insert them effortlessly during your testing sessions.

## About This Extension

This extension is a modern continuation of the original [Bug Magnet](https://github.com/gojko/bug-magnet), which is no longer supported by the latest versions of Chrome. It restores and improves the functionality so it works seamlessly in Chrome.

## Features

- Quick access to typical boundary values and tricky test cases for exploratory testing
- Easily extendable with your own configuration files
- Works on `input` fields, `textarea`s elements
- Supports multi-frame pages as long as frames belong to the same domain
- Minimal page overhead (<1 KB), no third-party dependencies, completely passive so it won’t interfere with your web app’s functionality

## How to Use

The easiest way to install is via the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/eeeeeeeeeeeee).

After installing, just right-click any editable element on a page, select the **Bug Finder** submenu, and click the value you want to insert — it will be added to the field automatically.
